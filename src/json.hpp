 * JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format is well known and used.
 * This module supports converting Warcraft III formats into and from JSON.
 * JSON can be handled by a widespread of tools and might be more useful than the custom formats of Warcraft III.
 * For example, using JSON in a version control system instead with textual diffs might make it much easier than using Warcraft III's binary formats.
 * jsonpath might help to query data.
