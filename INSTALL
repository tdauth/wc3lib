Consider that wc3lib supports runtime linking/loading by default which means that libraries
will be loaded at runtime and if loading fails an exception will be thrown.
Besides bear in mind that this does only affect external format libraries (e. g. JPEG library, not core libraries like Boost/Qt/KDE/Ogre).

Flags:
STATIC - Everything will be linked statically with applications if possible (creates big static wc3lib library).
NORUNTIME - Dynamic format libraries (e. g. jpeg library) will be linked during compilation and won't be loaded dynamically at runtime.
EDITOR - Wacraft III World Editor emulation is built. Qt/KDE is required!
PLUGINS - Could be used without EDITOR and installs Qt/KDE and OGRE format plugins only. Does not build the whole World Editor emulation.
DOC - Generates doxygen documentation (doxygen is required)

UI files:
If auto generating doesn't work (as for me) you could use script "generateui.sh".

Requirements (actual used versions, of course you could use others which are compliant with these):
Boost 1.46.1 (components: system filesystem thread serialization program_options iostreams)
bzip2 1.0.6-r2 (Boost support)
zlib 1.2.5-r2 (Boost support)
jpeg 8b (header only - runtime loading)

for EDITOR/PLUGINS flag only:
qt-core 4.7.2-r1
qt-gui 4.7.2
kdelibs 4.7
OGRE 1.7.3

Don't forget to place "ogre.cfg" and "plugins.cfg" files into working directory of editor application!
