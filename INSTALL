Consider that wc3lib supports runtime linking/loading by default which means that libraries
will be loaded at runtime and if loading fails an exception will be thrown.
Besides bear in mind that this does only affect external format libraries (e. g. JPEG library, not core libraries like Boost/Qt/KDE/Ogre).
For all available compile flags/options configure via cmake please and you'll get all options with their corresponding descriptions.

UI files:
If auto generating doesn't work (as for me) you could use script "generateui.sh".

Requirements (actual used versions, of course you could use others which are compliant with these):
Boost 1.46.1 (components: system filesystem thread serialization program_options iostreams)

for BLP flag only:
jpeg 8b (header only - runtime loading)

for MPQ flag only:
bzip2 1.0.6-r2 (Boost support)
zlib 1.2.5-r2 (Boost support)
crypto++ 5.6.1-r1 (RSA encryption, SHA1 and MD5 calculation)

for EDITOR/PLUGINS flag only:
qt-core 4.7.2-r1
qt-gui 4.7.2
kdelibs 4.7
OGRE 1.7.3

Don't forget to place "ogre.cfg" and "plugins.cfg" files into working directory of editor application!
